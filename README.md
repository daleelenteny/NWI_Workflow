# NWI_Workflow
These scripts were developed in ArcGIS Pro ModelBuilder to optimize, automate, and aid in QA/QC of data which will be submitted to the United State Fish and Wildlife Service for integration into the National Wetlands Inventory. 
Each script contains a more detailed description of its own function as well as its place in the workflow.
